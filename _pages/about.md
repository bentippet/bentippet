I am a lecturer in economics at the University of Greenwich, London. My research focuses on the following topics:

**The determinants of wealth inequality**

I am principal investigator on a BA/Leverhulme funded project bulding a new dataset on the wealthiest families in the UK from archives of The Sunday Times Rich list. This dataset will give a unique insight into how the very wealthiest people in the UK have accumulated their wealth. The data will be published in Spring 2025. 

**Wealth taxation**

I am currently supervising a PhD studentship on the long run impacts of net wealth taxation on the wealth distribution and macroeconomic factors. Static estimates of a net wealth tax show that a new wealth tax in the Uk could generate large revenues. This project analyses how these revenues will change over a long term horizon, when accounting for the impact wealth taxes will have on the wealth distribution directly and likely behavioural changes from those affected by the tax. 

**Climate change, inequality and climate action**

The world is currently not doing enough to mitigate climate change. This project analyses the determinants of climate mitigation and adaptation policies. In particular, I am interested in analysing the inter-relationship between inequality, climate disasters and climate action. 

**The macroeconomic and distributional impact of trade unions**

Institutions which influence worker's bargaining power, such as trade unions and collective bargaining agreements, shape distributional and macroeconomic outcomes. This project analyses the inter-relationship between wealth, worker's bargaining power
