I am a lecturer in economics at the University of Greenwich, London. My research focuses on the following topics:

**The determinants of wealth inequality**

I am principal investigator on a BA/Leverhulme funded project bulding a new dataset on the wealthiest families in the UK from archives of The Sunday Times Rich list. This dataset will give a unique insight into how the very wealthiest people in the UK have accumulated their wealth. The data will be published in Spring 2025. 

**Climate change, inequality and climate action**

The world is currently not doing enough to mitigate climate change. This project analyses the determinants of climate mitigation and adaptation policies, with a particular focus on the inter-relationship between inequality, climate disasters and climate action. 

**The macroeconomic and distributional impact of trade unions**

Institutions which influence worker's bargaining power, such as trade unions and collective bargaining agreements, shape distributional and macroeconomic outcomes. This project analyses how trade unions shape wealth inequality, unemployment and care work in global north countries. 

**Wealth taxation**

I am supervising a PhD studentship on the long run impacts of an annual net wealth taxation on the wealth distribution. The research goes beyond static revenue estimates of a wealth tax to model the impact an annual tax will have on the behaviour of those affected and macroeconomic outcomes.
